# FindMyStuff
This is a repository for the FindMyStuff app built as course project for Practice of Programming course(Winter 2015)

"MOTIVATION" : 
A web app (FindMyStuff) exists for IIIT students to report if they have lost or found items anywhere within the campus. We  created a mobile  app to make it easy for people to report lost or found  items while on the move. This removes the restriction on using a PC/laptop to be able to generate a report.

The application consists of Client and Server end.
  The client side is coded in android.
  The server is coded using spring-mvc , and run on a local host Apache tomcat server.
  
"TECHNOLOGY STACK" :
  Android (For client side)
  Retrofit (for sending post/get request’s from the client send)
  Spring MVC (Framework for developing Rest Api’s at the server side)
  MySQL (For Database)
  Jackson (for data marshalling and de-marshalling)
  Java Mail Api (for sending mail’s from the server side)
  Apache Tomcat
