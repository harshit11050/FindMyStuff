# FindMyStuff
This is a repository for the FindMyStuff app built as course project for Practice of Programming course(Winter 2015)

MOTIVATION : 
<br/>
A web app (FindMyStuff) exists for IIIT students to report if they have lost or found items anywhere within the campus. We  created a mobile  app to make it easy for people to report lost or found  items while on the move. This removes the restriction on using a PC/laptop to be able to generate a report.

The application consists of Client and Server end.<br/>
  The client side is coded in android.
  The server is coded using spring-mvc , and run on a local host Apache tomcat server.
  
TECHNOLOGY STACK : <br/>
  Android (For client side) <br/>
  Retrofit (for sending post/get request’s from the client send) <br/>
  Spring MVC (Framework for developing Rest Api’s at the server side) <br/>
  MySQL (For Database) <br/>
  Jackson (for data marshalling and de-marshalling)<br/>
  Java Mail Api (for sending mail’s from the server side)<br/>
  Apache Tomcat <br/>
